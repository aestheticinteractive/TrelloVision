## TrelloVision

The goal of TrelloVision is to create a series of views for your Trello data. Views like XML/CSV output, sortable table-based views, calendar-based views, searchable views, etc.

#### For Developers

TrelloVision is built in a very modular way, using AngularJS and other Javascript libraries. It is easy for other developers to add in their own custom views. Just provide a pull request, and we'll consider adding it to the main TrelloVision collection!

#### For Trello Users

Visit http://aestheticinteractive.github.io/TrelloVision to run the TrelloVision app. It will request **read-only** access to your public and private Trello boards. Don't worry -- TrelloVision does *nothing* with your data except display it back to you.
